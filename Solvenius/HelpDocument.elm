# Help

**Deduce as many sequences as you can, before the time runs out!**

When the game starts, you'll have to infer a sequence of *2 digits*; as the game goes on, sequences grow longer and longer - up to *9 digits*: the objective is to make a score greater than your previous top score.

There are no limits on the number of attempts you can perform; but time flows, making the game end as the countdown reaches 0.

Wrong input sequences will give you clues on the actual secret sequence; every digit will be:

* *green* if it is exactly in that position in the secret sequence

* *yellow* (and *underlined*) if it is in the secret sequence, but in another position

* *red* (and *stricken-through*, in *italic* style) if it is not in the secret sequence


Inferring the right sequence will make you earn points (the quicker you are, the more points you'll receive) and further time.
